            <p>Hello! My name is Carson Barnard, and I am a aspiring (and current) software engineer, working freelance currently until I obtain my degree. I was a student at UNCG from 2021 to 2025, where I walked the stage as a 'graduate'- However, I was 3 credits short from my degree requirement, so here I am. I am excited to be enrolled in this course as web design is a big passion of mine, and while this first assignment did not outline any stylization elements I thought some basic bootstrapping would be appropriate :)</p>
            <p>While I was at UNCG, I was passionate in community service and active in the schools local community, and developed 3 applications. 2 of which are web apps, and 1 is a iOS app. I am really excited to get my degree and enter my career, so I can realize my dream of being a successful engineer.</p>

            <img src="img/me.jpg" alt="me" class="img-fluid rounded-circle mt-4 mx-auto d-block mb-4" style="max-width: 400px;"/>
            <p>Here is a picture of me and my lovely girlfriend, who has supported me through my college career as she works a full-time job.</p>
            <p>At A&T, this is actually my only course I am taking! I only needed a remainder of 3 credits to obtain my degree, so I chose to take this class since the head of the Comp Sci department at UNCG said she would allow it to transfer. So, the only course is COMP-322. Super excited to see what this summer semester holds for me!</p>
